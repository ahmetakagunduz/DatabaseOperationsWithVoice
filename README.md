# DatabaseOperationsWithVoice
 
Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Conversions: The project utilizes the SpeechLib and Speech Recognition libraries to facilitate seamless conversions between speech and text, as well as text-to-speech functionalities. This allows users to issue voice commands or hear texts in a spoken format.

Database Entry via Voice: A feature has been integrated to allow users to input data into the database using voice commands. This enables users to perform data entry tasks solely through voice instructions, enhancing efficiency. SQL is employed for database management.

Future Integration with YOLO for Object Detection: I am planning to integrate the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm soon to add object detection capabilities. This will enable users to identify objects in images or videos, enriching the functionality of the project.
